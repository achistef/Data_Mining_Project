This Project is for the data-mining course 2019 ID2211 at the KTH.


## The Report
The actual report of the project can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wrgfwpzgdkhm).

## The Goal
We want to analyse Stack Overflow's Community structure and also came up with a way to predict users which are capable of answering a specific question

## The structure
As we used two languages, java and python, the first level of this project just divides those two. The java part focuses on tags and measures the similarity of users with the help of those.
The python part is capable of creating a table which maps users to questions, the user actively participate in for of either questions, answers or comments.
